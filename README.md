# snail-asm
A custom version of assembly (that runs on the web), that I made in a couple days. Very, very slow, and not very useful.

The list of instructions has been moved to inside the website.

Comments can be placed anywhere, as long as they're not on a new line, or after any instruction that doesn't have a set number of parameters (`log` etc); any unexpected parameters after a instruction are discarded.

Version 1.4:
 * Added the `fast` and `upd` instructions, which make your programs run faster!
