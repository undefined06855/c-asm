# snail-asm
A custom assembly-like interpreted language (that runs on the web, in your browser), that I made in a couple days. Somewhat slow, and not very useful.

The list of instructions has been moved to inside the website.

Comments can be placed anywhere, as long as the first word is not a instruction (if it is on a new line), or after any instruction that doesn't have a set number of parameters (`log` etc); any unexpected parameters after a instruction are discarded.

Version 1.6:
 * Fixed some stuff, old scripts will not be compatible with the new version! ~~Disabled examples button.~~ Examples button has been enabled again.
